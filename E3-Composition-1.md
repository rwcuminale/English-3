# Composition 1: Summer Reading Assignment

**What did you think of the summer reading book, *Boxers & Saints?"* **

The question, "What did you think of a book?" takes an underrated amount of skill to answer. It's not one simply to respond with a kneejerk reaction, because your answer to this question says not just something about the book, but a lot about you as well. To answer this question well, consider responding to any combination of these, slightly more precise, prompts:
  - What was your experience reading this book?
  - What other ideas or issues did the book make you think about?
  - What did you find interesting, useful, or important about the book?

This essay is your academic introduction to me as your teacher. It will show me how and what kinds of things you think about a literary text. Be honest, and do your best. This paper will count for 10% of your first marking period grade. Let the following rubric guide you:
  - Content: This paper should be a combination of your thinking and specific references to the text. Your writing should be clearly engaged with the book, not just writing around it.
  - Structure: Do not worry about a thesis or central driving idea, however your ideas should be structured in unified, coherent paragraphs. Allow yourself to drastically change topics or contradict your ideas without penalty.
  - Grammar and Syntax: No need for complexity -- simply write clear, complete sentences and avoid careless errors.
  - Length: No fewer than 500 words will earn an A, no fewer than 300 words will pass (i.e., 300 -- 500 words).
