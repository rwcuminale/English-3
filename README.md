## Overview

<!--Fix this to make it more readable: the sentences are too long--!>
English 3 aims to cultivate intellectual skills and habits of mind to help you grow as a person. 
At the same time, you will engage with and hopefully appreciate works of authentic literary and rhetorical merit. 
There is a strong structural focus to the course, 
  meaning it will look at language on a fundamental level, examining how its elements work together.
Specifically, we will be taking a close look at the writing process, elements of literature and rhetoric, the explicit functions of grammar, and the representational nature of language as a whole. 
The course texts explore both themes and genres, while keeping an open mind to areas of interest that will naturally arise along the way.
We will also strive to align our studies with American History and Civics courses wherever possible.

## Goals

The course goals are aligned with mastery of the Connecticut Common Core State Standards for Grade 11. 
Below list the skills, habits, and practices the course values in addition to the Common Core:

1. Writing Process

2. Writing Freedom

3. Power, Protest and Change

4. Facing our Fears

5. College Essay

## Grading and Assessment

### Papers and Projects: 60%

Each quarter you will complete five major papers or projects. 
These assignments are a learning opportunity to grow in knowledge and skill as well as a measure of your abilities in English. 
In other words, the experience of writing carries a measure of importance along with the actual product. 
You will never receive a failing grade for your writing quality --- you only fail if you do not follow directions. 
Expect papers to vary in length: the majority will be 300 - 500 words, 
  but you will have one paper per quarter that is generally around the length of 1000 - 2000 words. 

### Participation: 40%

The participation grade describes engagement with the course and the course activities.
Every class you begin with a 8/10 "Participation" grade for being present and attentive. 
Students earn a 10/10 by making an active contribution to the academic environment.
Every class also has a "Prepared" grade for being ready to work when class begins.
This grade is either a 0/10 or a 10/10; you are either prepared or you are not.
Lastly, you will earn a "Classwork" grade every class for in-class assignments.

#### Personal Reading

This course values the habit of reading extended texts. 
We all read manifold texts throughout during the day, 
  but there is something important about the experience of becoming immersed in a good book. 
Therefore, I periodically dedicate class time to reading for pleasure. 
Every class you must be prepared with a book you will enjoy reading. 
I have a selection of interesting works if you would like to borrow one from time to time. 
Please see me to check one out.

#### Journal Writing

It's self-evident that the more you write, the easier writing becomes and the more you grow. 
Research strongly suggests that the physical act of writing increases your focus and cultivates more sophisticated thinking. 
For this reason I often dedicate class time to write freely in a personal journal. 
You will also use this as a repository for your in-class notes, ideas, and pre-writing strategies. 
I will collect them from time to time to assess them for length: 
  you should aim to write roughly one full page per writing session (150-200 words).

#### Class Activities

I design class activities to create meaningful educational experiences. 
Furthermore, following directions and trying your best are important aspects of belonging to a learning community. 
When you don't work hard 
  --- even if you are quiet and not "disruptive" --- 
  it nevertheless affects both your learning experience \emph{and those around you. 
Do your best every class.

#### Reflective Writing

Often at the end of class you will receive a short writing prompt to reinforce or extend the lines of inquiry of the day's lesson. 
Honest, informal, short but intelligent writing is valued here. 

#### SAT Practice

Beginning in October, you will have weekly lessons and exercises
to prepare for the SAT exam. These activities will form a
discrete part of your participation grade --- in the beginning
of the year the exercises will be graded for quality of
completion as you grow used to the questions and expectations,
but as we approach the SAT exam the exercises will be graded for
correctness as well. All of the lessons will be posted to Canvas
(see sec. 6.1), with paper materials supplied to you in
class. You will complete and submit your work weekly on the last
class of the week, I will assess it over the weekend, and we
will review your work the following class when you will have the
opportunity to ask questions and discuss strategies.

#### Vocabulary
 
   Like your other English courses, this course also utilizes the
   Membean program to help improve your vocabulary. Before the SAT,
   you are to work with Membean for 20 minutes pep week, and after
   the SAT exam (and during weeks we are not working on SAT
   preparation exercises) you are required to work with the program
   for forty minutes per week. You will also receive periodic
   Membean assessments from time to time.

### Formative Assessments

  Throughout the course you will receive feedback on your skill
  level and growth, especially as it relates to the major
  papers. These grades will be scored a 1 - 4 according to the
  paper's rubric, but students will often receive narrative or
  comment-based feedback too. Although the grade book will reflect
  this progress, and your engagement with these activities affects
  your participation grade, the assignments' grades themselves are
  not counted in the quarter average: they exist purely for feedback
  purposes. 

### Honors Opportunity

 You may take this course with honors, meaning you will receive
 additional texts, additional and more rigorous composition prompts
 with additional teacher feedback, and a GPA increase reflected
 on your transcript. To qualify for Honors you must do the following:

  \begin{itemize
   \item Indicate through email your desire to enroll with honors;
   \item Complete the Individual / Group Read Projects every
    quarter;
   \item Accept the following modifications to standard curriculum
    assignments;
   \begin{itemize
    \item Modified midterm and final exams to include increased
     content knowledge and distinct, honors essay;
    \item 1,000 minimum to all papers;
    \item Supplemental readings to accompany course texts;
    \item 10\% penalty per day for late work.
   \end{itemize
  \end{itemize

## Policies and Procedures

### Logistics

  I will communicate assignments to you in class, write them on the board, and give time at the end of class for entering this information into a planner. Students are expected to track their assignments. I collect assignments as hard copies or emailed pdf’s. I post assignments and classroom announcements on Twitter.

### Preparation

  Every class come prepared with a pen or pencil, writing journal,
  and personal read book. You must also bring any texts or
  assignments we are working with for the day. There is otherwise
  nothing else you need, so backpacks should be left in your locker
  or you must place them in the designated areas in the classroom
  away from your desk. Your preparation will directly impact your
  participation grade every class.

### Deadlines

All papers and projects have deadlines. No paper or project will be received after the deadline.
Classwork can be made up at my discretion
  (some work --- discussions, for example --- lose their value when
  outside the context of the specific class).

### Electronics and Phones

  Phones are not permitted in class. I will confiscate phones if they
  are used during class and return them to you after the period
  ends. Listening to music is not allowed during composition, although I
  will play music while you write sometimes in order to cultivate the
  habit of being able to write both during silence (as in standardized
  tests) and during distracting noise (as often occurs when we compose
  outside the classroom). There may be times when you type in class and
  at those times only are you allowed to use your own laptop.

### Attendance

  Excused absences result in excused class participation for the
  You are counted absent if you do not show up to class or are
  absent without permission. If you are absent for an in-class assignment, you must make it up for homework. If you are absent for a quiz, you must take it the day you return. Unexcused absences will not be afforded these opportunities: the work will count as a zero.
. Tardies and absences will also affect
  participation grades.

  For excused absences, you are excused from the participation grade
  for the day, and any major deadlines are moved to the next class;
  unexcused absences result in a zero for class participation and
  all work required that day is considered late. Please do not
  hesitate to communicate with me if there are any special
  circumstances that affect your ability to attend or participate in
  this course.
  
### Class Conduct
 
  I take the school rules seriously. Dress code violations, cruel or
  inappropriate language, and disruptive behavior will be addressed
  immediately with a call home and an automatic administrative
  write-up. Disrespect to the course, teacher, or other students
  will not be tolerated. I consider disrespect to include direct or
  indirect hostile language or behavior either student-to-student,
  student-to-teacher, or teacher-to-student. Food and drink are not
  allowed under any circumstances. Lastly, please respect the class
  time: do not come to talk to me while I have another class; I am
  happy to have a conference with you after school or by
  appointment.
