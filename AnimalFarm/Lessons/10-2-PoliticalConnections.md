# Animal Farm
#### Connecting the Farm to The United States

## Plan

1. Present the Question: Is Animal Farm important? Something is Wrong with out Country.
2. Present the News
  * Trump: [96 billion for Puerto Rico](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1125396971009859585) vs. [FEMA](https://recovery.fema.gov/state-profiles); but [Senior Administration Official Covers](https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2019/apr/03/donald-trump/trumps-false-tweet-puerto-rico-got-91-billion-hurr/)
  * [One million extinctions vs. new opportunities for trade](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/05/07/day-million-species-are-announced-be-brink-extinction-us-says-melting-ice-creates-new-opportunities-trade/?utm_term=.c75b440cb43f)
  * Trump lost 1 billion in 1985-94
    - Median income in US is under $60k
    - With this income, it would take 16,667 years to earn what he lost in ten.
    - Trump is not the wealthiest
    - [Jeff Bezos made $46 billion last year](http://money.com/money/5481695/jeff-bezos-net-worth-amazon-2018/) 
    - [Jeff Bezos is worth $131 billion as of May 10, 2019](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2019/03/04/this-is-the-richest-person-in-the-world/#8b6e4d336db6)
    - He made $126 million per day. If I were to double my salary it would take me more than a thousand years to make what he makes in a day.
  * [A man died after a GoFundMe campaign for insulin ran $50 short](https://www.thenation.com/article/alex-azar-trumps-hhs-pick-has-already-been-a-disaster-for-people-with-diabetes/)
  * Fake News? Why might the idea of fake news serve the state?
3. Questions:
  * Why isn't anyone doing anything about this?
  * How does this connect to Animal Farm?
  * How is this likely to continue?
  * What can be done? --> Social Studies
4. Graded Discussion
5. Talk about reproductive labor
 * The wealthy are in control
 * What do you think they want from schools?
 * Compliant, skilled employees. Look at how education works, and you'll see it
   - Test scores and grades and how students compete
   - Competition between schools to get higher scores
   - Education quality remains with ruling class: education to rule vs. education to work
5. Present Paper 3
