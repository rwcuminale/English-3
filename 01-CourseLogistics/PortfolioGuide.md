# Portfolio Guide

## Overview

Your portfolio is a demonstration of your knowledge, ability, and hard work for the period of the first semester at the midterm and the entire year at the final.
A carefully prepared portfolio shows both what you have done and what you are able to do.
Because of this comprehensive quality, these portfolio assessments count for 10% of your grade at each presentation.

## The following materials are required for your portfolio:

### Coursework Artifacts

In a binder or folder, collect the following and assemble them in order:

- In-class journal writing prompts
- Composition assignments with drafts and feedback, in order of completion from earliest to latest.
- Quarterly papers with drafts and feedback
- Reflections on quarterly group projects

### Portfolio Reflection

In a typed composition, choose to do one of the following and enclose it before your coursework artifacts:

- Address the following ten prompts, writing no fewer than 100 words each.
- Write a 1,000-word reflection that incorporates the prompts in your own creative way.
- Write a 1,000-word narrative that tells the story of your writing over the period covered by this portfolio.

These are the prompts:
1. What is your favorite piece of writing included in this portfolio? Something you're proud of?
1. What do you see as the special strengths in this favorite piece of writing?
1. How have you grown as a writer over this period of time?
1. Did you ever do more or less than was required for the assignment? Why do you think that is?
1. What is something you'd like to improve about your writing?
1. How has this course affected you as a person? How is this reflected in your journal writing or other portfolio materials?
1. What did you expect to learn, and did that match up what you actually learned?
1. How has your start-to-finish process of writing compositions and papers evolved over time?
1. Is there an area or focus you'd like to develop in the future?
1. Did you achieve the goals you set for yourself at the beginning of the year? Are you making good progress?
