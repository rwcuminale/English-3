<!--OLD

Most importantly, above all else, my aim as an instructor is for students to leave this course with five things:

* Knowledge that the writing process generates ideas, and the best way to beat writers block is to write;
* Insight into confusion as an opportunity to discover your best thinking;
* Understanding of the importance and relevance of literary and rhetorical voices, even if they're different from your own;
* A developed habit of reading and listening critically so you are not easily fooled.
* Both positive experiences and increased skills of reading and writing through a thoughtfully arranged curriculum of study.
